# eBabel home

HTML only homepage to any project of mine. 

This is my gateway that's easy to edit with pure HTML, without any server side processing to allow maximum flexibility of creating unique designs and layouts.

This is a single page that leads to other projects. It's not the start of a website with a template to reuse, it's a unique page "site" that effectively acts as a portfolio of every project I ever made and want to share publicly.

## gh-pages hosting without CNAME

If there is no CNAME in the root directory of the gh-pages branch, the site is visible at http://ebabel-eu.github.io/ebabel-home/

## gh-pages hosting with CNAME

If there is a CNAME and the DNS has been setup, the site is visible at the address mentioned in the CNAME file.


todo:

* add a CNAME file to the root of gh-pages branch. Write only home.ebabel.eu in it.
